# Duncan's Speedrun Mod
A 1.16.1 mod for practicing 1.14.4/1.16.1 speedruns.

Most practice modes are per world, meaning if you want to restart or change a practice, you must create a new world.

__Do not use this mod on your own worlds. Any damage done to a world with this mod is irreversible.__
## Modes
### Lava Practice
A resettable (within world) and timed practice for making nether portals with a water bucket, stone pickaxe, 10 dirt, a stone shovel, and a flint and steel. 
### Nether/Fortress Practice
Instant teleportation to the nether with a stone sword/pickaxe/shovel/axe, along with a water bucket, flint and steel, boat, shield, 2 golden apples, and 32 bread. Fortress practice is the same thing, but it puts you next to a fortress.
### TNT Practice
Choosing this option will teleport you to a mansion (because it's always in a roofed forest). You are given a stack of TNT, a stack of dirt, a flint and steel, and infinite health/hunger. This mode also tracks how many tnt you have used, and how many logs the tnt has blown up in total. It also calculates the average per tnt.
### 1.14.4 Trading Practice
The [infinite restock bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-157136) is reintroduced and you are placed in a shroomlight room with 6 stacks of logs, 2 fletching tables, a brewing stand, and 4 villagers.
### Eye/Stronghold/End Practice
All 3 modes give these items:
- Stone sword/pickaxe/shovel/axe, 1 stack of cobblestone, a water bucket, a flint and steel, a bow, a stack of arrows, a boat, and 10 white beds.

Here's what they do differently:
- The eye practice places you at x=0, z=0 and also gives you 7 blaze rods and 14 ender pearls..
- The stronghold practice places you inside the closest stronghold and also gives you 12 eyes of ender.
- The end practice places you inside the end.
## A Note for Mod Developers
This mod is not a real mod; this is just a datapack packaged into a mod. Since I don't know anything about real modding, feel free to make this into a real mod if you like. If you have any simple improvements that I can add such as removing the need for the fabric API or correcting something that I've done wrong, I would appreciate it if you can let me know.
